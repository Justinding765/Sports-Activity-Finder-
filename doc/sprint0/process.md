# Process
### Q:  How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?  
The team organized was using the “find a team member” thread on piazza. Further communication was done through email, and group members 
were invited to the group discord server for this project. Discord will be the main form communication
### Q: How did you make decisions?  
Decisions were made based on majority agreement, preference and convenience. This included decisions regarding product idea, task assignment, and meeting times
### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? 
We would have a vote on priority of user stories. Since we are 6 members, if we had a tie we would discuss that specific user story and continue to 
have rounds of voting until a majority was decided for that story. Most user stories needed one round
### Q: How frequently did you meet?  
We meet around every 3-4 days consisting of both in person and online meetings
### Q: What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
Increase the number of meetings to every 2-3 days, as the next phases will likely require more frequent discussion, especially when it comes to coding the website. 
Proper communication will be key in this project. Communicate more with the TA and Professor when it comes to any confusions or clarifications

Overall, the team worked effectively, efficiently, and communciation was thorough and clear. Also 
tasks were distributed evenly, and completed on time
