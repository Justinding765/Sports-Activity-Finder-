Release goals:
    The goal is to have a working browser based application that allows users to create unique profiles (US5) for discovering other users engaging in their desired activites, join groups based on those activities, create such groups, and add users to their friend list with ability to message each other. Users need to be able to search for other users by distance from them and by skill level based on the activity. The app needs to have an intuitive and friendly interface design.
