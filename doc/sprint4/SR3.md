# Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants: 
Denis, Iangola, Jesse, Justin, Shaahid, Sharon

# Unfinished Tasks:
- CRUN-37 search by activities (partially completed moved to next sprint)

## Practices to Continue Using:
- Regular standups
- Frequently communicating progress over discord text when necessary
- Providing aids to fellow team members for learning new technologies - good team mentality
- Discussing ideas for implementations to coordinate with other team members working on other features
- Breaking user stories into subtasks
- Have commit messages beginning with the ticket number from Trello followed by message of what was updated
- Have endpoints in documentation

## New Practices to Use:
- More frequent merges into develop (so everyone can get the latest updates)

## Harmful Practices to Stop Using:
- Leave documentation until last minute

## Best Experiences:
- Major features are coming together
- No last minute rush due to spreading out the work well throughout the sprint 

## Worst Experiences:
- Less touchpoints between the entire team caused by busier schedules - looking to increase communication back to our regular levels next sprint
