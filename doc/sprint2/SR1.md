## Practices to Continue Using
- Regular standups
- Frequently communicating progress over discord text when necessary
- Providing aids to fellow team members for learning new technologies - good team mentality

## New Practices to Use
- Add acceptance criteria to our user stories in Trello
- Break user stories into smaller subtasks
  - Move unfinished tasks so done and partially done is distinguishable on Trello
- Update burndown chart on a regular basis
- More frequent merges into develop (so everyone can get the latest updates)
- Git commit messages beginning with the ticket number from Trello followed by message of what was updated
- Git branch naming - ticket number from Trello

## Harmful Practices to Stop Using
- Inconsistencies in file naming, structure, etc.
- Leaving documentation till the last minute

## Best Experiences
- Beginning workflow and getting a direction of where to head with further sprints
- Slowly getting an understanding of React and other new technologies

## Worst Experiences
- Lack of organization 
- Last minute merging of branches
